- Advanced data visualization and statistical modeling in R
- Policy-relevant analysis with stakeholder communication

## Results
After 6 months of grants, members report improved financial stability, employment gains, increased housing security, and stronger community ties. 

**Key Findings:**
- **Financial Stability**: Grants help members afford daily costs of life in Austin. For the majority, paying for basic needs like housing, transportation, food, and family caregiving is less difficult than at program start
- **Employment Progress**: 55% of those who had employment goals at program start have found new jobs or increased work hours
- **Housing Security**: 44% of those behind on rent/mortgage payments at program start have caught up. 2 members bought houses!
- **Community Impact**: Members report stronger community relationships and provide more frequent support (monetary and non-monetary) to family, friends, and neighbors
