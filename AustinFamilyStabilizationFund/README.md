## Results
After 6 months of grants, members report improved financial stability, employment gains, increased housing security, and stronger community ties. 
- The grants are helping members afford daily costs of life in Austin. For the majority of members, paying for basic needs like housing, transportation, food, and family caregiving, is less difficult now than it was at the start of the grants
- Workforce participation is strong and members have made considerable progress on employment goals. 55% of those who had an employment goal at the start of the grants have found a new job or increased their work hours. 
- The grants are helping members progress on housing goals, especially around moving, and catching up on housing payments. 44% of those who were behind on rent or mortgage payments at the start of the grants have now caught up. 2 members bought a house!
- Members report feeling stronger relationships with their community and they have been providing more frequent support, both monetary and non-monetary. The grants have had a ripple effect as members support their family, friends, and neighbors with basic needs.
